![ICO Pooling For Syndicates](https://wiki.thm.de/w/images/7/7f/Profil.png)

ICO's provide whitelists for favored investors, or friends/advisors. This guarantees them a certain amount of assets to be purchased. Typically with these whitelists, the allocation is larger than they're able to personally fill, so they will then provide some of the allocation to interested parties they know.

ICO Structures differ
- Organized - Accredited sign up, receive verified and unique smart contract address. (Civic)
- Tsunami - One address, flooding in from everyone, everywhere at one time. (Brave browser)
- Time Sensitive Blocks - Allocated an amount that they can purchase when signing up, amount being received will vary based on the time the deposit is made to the ICO.

## Problem

**Technical** 

Groups that are all contributing to a whitelist need two points of trust.

  a) Group organizer to deliver funds to the whitelist.
  
  b) Whitelist person to deliver their tokens.
  
**Convenience**

Investing in ICO's forces multiple parties in multiple areas of the globe to be ready to go at a time that may or may not be convenient to them.


## Solution

A smart contract that takes the deposits from people, with a fixed destination (white-list, or ICO) to push those deposits too.

All tokens that were received (or to be received) from the ICO will be allocated back to the contract.

Tokens are distributed pro-rata. E.g. 100 people all deposit 1 ETH into the smart contract, the smart contract manages to deposit 90 ETH to the ICO, then everyone gets 1% of the tokens received, and rebated the additional ETH that was not able to be spent.
 

## üëå **Good use cases** üëå 
- You and your friends are syndicating funds together to send over to a whitelist. For peace of mind, you implement this contract together to ensure that funds are going where they're supposed to be, and have full visibility on the contribution amount.

- ICO creator being able to deploy these contracts on the whitelist. Each contract would have a particular whitelist that it's allowed to receive from (E.g. Syndicate 1 contract address "0x12345", and Syndicate 2 contract address "0x09876", all other deposits aren't permitted).

*E.g. mikeCoin ICO is going to whitelist a handful of addresses. People who are able to participate in these whitelists are to provide their syndicates contract address to be added. Contributions will be taken directly from the contract, and distributed accordingly.*


- Collecting the syndicates deposits, and their specified/allowed deposit address into the ICO. Leveraging the contract to make those deposits on behalf of everyone in the most timely manner, and then take all the tokens received, and push back to everyone. Minimizing mass inconvenience for multiple parties, and also providing a strong opportunity to receive the most amount of tokens possible.

### *Comment*

This is called "Scarab" because there's a beetle called a Cyphochilus. It's the whitest color in nature, and figuring that this is all about whitelists, and the whitelists whitelisting address, it was getting somewhat [heavy](https://imgur.com/xoNEXkT) on that word.

Welcome any feedback of course, and if this is already in existence, then cool! 

Thanks so much :)

Kind regards,

Michael.
